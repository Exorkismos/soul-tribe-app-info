## Partner & Upper-Level User Marketplace Access

### 1. Professional Partners
- **External professionals** (coaches, holistic providers, etc.) can apply for marketplace access via standard partner vetting and approval.
- Upon approval, receive “Partner” or “Pro” status and can list products/services, advertise, and receive payouts per the commission structure.

  - Users must meet all of the following:
    - Premium or VIP membership, OR
    - Dharma score above a threshold (e.g., 100+)
    - No unresolved karma penalties in the last 60 days
    - Account in good standing (no bans, not in “toxic/karmic” isolation)
    - Optionally, must have been active for at least 90 days
- **Application & Approval:**  
  - Eligible users may submit product/service listings for review.
  - Listings reviewed for quality, relevance, and safety by moderators or admin staff.
- **Marketplace Participation:**  
  - Approved users can list/sell offerings in the marketplace, subject to same commission/compliance as external partners.
  - Their vendor identity is marked as “Community Creator.”
  - All listings are subject to periodic review and can be suspended/removed for complaints or violations.

### 4. Payment and Payout Flow

**A. Checkout:**  
- Partners/creators can choose:
  - Process payments within the app (recommended for trust/commission control, and to enable money-back guarantee), or
  - Redirect to their own secure site for checkout.

**B. Payout Timing:**  
- Payouts are made:
  1. Immediately after sale (for some products/services)
  2. Or, after user confirms delivery/satisfaction  
  3. All transactions are covered by a time-limited money-back guarantee (duration set by admin, e.g., 7 or 14 days).

### 5. Commission Structure

| Vendor Type        | Sales Volume (30-day) | Suggested Commission Rate |
|--------------------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| Partner/Pro        | Any                  | 10%                      |
| Community Creator  | Any                  | 7%                       |
| Either             | > $5,000             | 5%                       |
| Either             | < $100               | 15%                      |

- **Logic:**  
  - Default for Partners: 10%.  
  - Default for Community Creators: 7%.  
  - If the vendor's 30-day sales volume exceeds $5,000, commission drops to 5% for the following month.  
  - If a vendor’s monthly sales are below $100, commission increases to 15% for the following month (to offset processing/admin costs).
  - **Admin can override per vendor or listing.**

---

### 6. Money-Back Guarantee

- **Suggested Default:**  
  - 14 days from the date of sale.
  - Applies only to purchases completed within the platform.
  - User must request a refund via their order history within 14 days.
  - If a dispute is raised, payout to vendor is delayed until resolved or guarantee window expires.

---

### 7. Vendor Trust Requirements

- **Suggested Default for Trusted Vendor Status (for faster payouts/auto-approval):**
  - At least 90 days on platform
  - No unresolved complaints in the last 60 days
  - Average product/service rating of 4.5+ (out of 5)
  - Verified identity and credentials on file

---

### 8. Auto-Approval & Payout Logic

- **Trusted vendors:** Payouts are auto-processed after 3 days unless complaint is filed.
- **New/untrusted vendors:** Payouts processed only after user confirms delivery/satisfaction or after the 14-day guarantee expires.

---

### 9. Ad Placement & Targeting

**A. Ad Placement:**  
- Marketplace has a dedicated tab for all users to browse.
- Ads may also appear as homepage banners for visibility.
- VIP members can choose to hide marketplace and ad banners (except for header ads, which always display).
- All other users see marketplace and ads as designed.

**B. Ad Formats:**  
- Static image ads
- Video ads

**Side Note: “Free Basic Option” for Professionals:**  
- Professionals will be periodically surveyed or asked during onboarding if they are willing to provide a limited “free basic reading/service” to users.
- If agreed:
  - Their listings are highlighted in interactive features (e.g., “Free Sample Readings!”).
  - They receive a discount on the commission fee for sales/leads generated via the app.
  - This encourages professionals to contribute value to the community in exchange for business promotion.

---

### 10. User Experience & Controls

**A. Ratings/Reviews:**  
- Users can rate and review both vendors and products/services.

**B. Reporting/Praise:**  
- Only admins can take moderation actions, but users can submit complaints or praise (feedback is logged and may be considered in vendor evaluations).

---

### 11. Workflow for Partner/Creator Onboarding

1. Applicant submits required info and documents, including:
    - Identity verification (e.g., government-issued ID, selfie, etc.)
    - Professional/business credentials (licenses, certifications, relevant education)
2. System runs automated checks (ID validation, credential matching).
3. Admin manually reviews application and supporting materials.
4. If approved:
   - Partner or creator can list products/services in the marketplace.
   - Optionally, during onboarding, they can opt-in for “free basic” feature for a commission discount.
5. If rejected, feedback is provided and the applicant may reapply after a cooldown period.
