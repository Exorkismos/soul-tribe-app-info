- **Can be purchased or earned through participation**
- **13 Degrees:** Unlocks privileges, badges, features, host/mentor roles, exclusive content, and governance input

### Karma (Negative Points)
- **Accrued:** Toxic, disruptive, or harmful actions; breaking guidelines
- **Acts as restriction:** Each degree increases restrictions
- **Cannot be purchased down (except redemption for minor infractions); requires positive actions**
- **13 Degrees:** See Karma Levels below

- **Progression:** Each infraction increases degree; severe violations can escalate multiple degrees or to 13 immediately
- **Redemption:** Reduce karma by earning dharma via positive actions, challenges, or redemption (if allowed)
- **Transparency:** Users see their degree and requirements for improvement

## Policy Highlights

### 1. Zero Tolerance for Severe Violations

**Who:**  
- Scammers, spammers, solicitors of adult services, or offsite/unapproved products

**Action:**  
- Immediate Degree 13 (ban)
- No second chances or redemption via dharma during ban; appeals only via moderator review
- Offending content removed; illegal activities reported as required
- Automated and community reporting prioritized

### 2. Three Chances Policy for Toxic & Karmic Users

**Who:**  
- Users with negative but not severe behavior

**Details:**  
- 3 warnings/restrictions per calendar month
- Each infraction = warning and a chance to redeem (positive activity, dharma purchase, or challenge)
- After 3rd, suspension or ban; resets monthly

### 3. General User Behavior & Redemption

- Negative actions = karma (restrictions), positive actions = dharma (privileges)
- Appeals allowed; redemption via positive participation and, when permitted, through dharma
- Abuse of reporting/redemption is penalized

---

## Additional Features

- **Moderation:** AI/automation plus trusted user moderators
- **Onboarding:** Limited access until baseline dharma earned
- **Support:** Karma/dharma status visible; clear policy access; support channels

---

## UI/UX Considerations

- **Status Indicators:** Clear karma/dharma level and consequences/rewards
- **Badges:** For high dharma, warning for high karma
- **Redemption Paths:** Guided ways to improve karma/earn dharma
- **Safety Prompts:** Warnings before risky actions

---

## Example User Flows

### Karma Reduction (Redemption)
1. User receives restriction (e.g., muted)
2. App displays reason, degree, and clear path to redemption (e.g., join group meditation, complete kindness challenge, or—if allowed—purchase dharma)
3. Progress tracked; upon completion, karma degree reduced and features restored

### Zero Tolerance Enforcement
1. User posts prohibited content (e.g., spam, scam, or solicitation)
2. Automated or moderator detection triggers immediate ban (Degree 13)
3. Content removed, user notified, with appeal link

---

## Transparency & Appeals

- All users can view their karma/dharma history and current status
- Clear explanations for restrictions or privileges
- Appeals are reviewed by moderators for fairness
